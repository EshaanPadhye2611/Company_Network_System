# Company_Network_System
The primary objective was to establish a scalable, reliable, and secure network infrastructure to support the operational needs of 600 staff across various departments.

Implementation Highlights:

Hierarchical Network Design: Adopted a hierarchical network model to streamline traffic management and enhance network performance.

Redundancy and Fault Tolerance: Integrated two routers and two multilayer switches, each connected to dual ISPs, to ensure network resilience and uninterrupted internet access.

VLAN and Subnetting Strategy: Configured separate VLANs for each department and conducted detailed subnetting based on the number of users and devices in each department.

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP): Set up dedicated DHCP servers in the server room to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices across the network.

Static IP Configuration: Allocated static IP addresses to critical devices in the server room for enhanced control and security.

Open Shortest Path First (OSPF): Implemented OSPF for efficient internal route advertisement and optimal path selection.

Secure Shell (SSH): Enabled SSH on all routers and multilayer switches for secure remote management of network devices.

Port Security: Configured port-security features to limit device connections on sensitive network ports, enhancing internal security measures.

Network Address Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT): Implemented NAT/PAT to manage and translate internal IP addresses for outbound internet connections while conserving public IP addresses.

Technologies Used:

Cisco Packet Tracer: Utilized for network simulation, design, and troubleshooting before actual deployment.

Cisco Networking Equipment: Routers, multilayer switches, and wireless access points to ensure robust connectivity and performance.

Security Implementations: ACLs, SSH, OSPF, and VLAN configurations to secure network data and manage access controls efficiently.
